- added models to predict production quantity
- added grid search and random search cross validation to find best model 
- added predictions for increased temperatures
- woorked on report

12/13
- processing climate data based on regions turned out to be more computationally expensive in terms of time and space due to area considered and thus the idea was dropped. for example, processing climate data for one variable over 1979-2020 for China which has 19 regions is estimated to take 40 days while processing climate data for one variable over 1979 - 2020 for Rwanda which has 10 regions is estimated to take 60 hours (lower bound). 
- instead processing climate data at country level as this is more time and space efficient - ending up with .... datapoints for analysis.
- reran EDA with new dataset
- reran modeling with new dataset
- worked on report


12/12
- updated code for processing climate data
- started processing climate data for regions
- updated EDA
- updated modeling

12/11
- finished downloading climate data for newly defined regions

12/08
- updated code for downloading data from AgERA5
- uploaded data for newly defined regions
- updated code for processing yield data for regions


12/07
- based on feedback from presentation, adding more data points by including 10 more countries and redefining existing regions to be seperate states


12/05
- more EDA and further processed data
- implemented regression and tree based models to predict yield
- worked on presentation


12/04
- uploaded EDA of processed data

12/03
- finished downloading and processing climate data from AgERA4
- raw files can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cLRvhx9XZB-iQlnyl9oBgcigPk27chGk/view?usp=sharing


11/30
- uploaded file for processing data downloaded from AgERA5
- next steps: once all data has been downloaded (currently only 3 countries have been downloaded), process them using this file


11/27
- updated list of countries with production regions and latitude and longitude information for getting data from AgERA5
- map of production regions can be accessed here: https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=18_4lE3ifXs3lbaH939dpu8M3VtErJac&usp=sharing
- updated file for downloading data from AgERA5 to get data from all countries, years and variables
- files downloaded are in NC format - need to convert to tabular data that can be further processed 

11/23
- narrowed down production zone based on existing papers from 1980s-1990s


11/11
- met with Dafne to discuss issue with temporal and spatial scale of data
- next steps: narrow down production zone in each country in order to select climate data and aggregate climate data over region 
- once all data is processed, build regression based and/or tree based model


11/08
- further pre processing of agricultural yield data
- next steps: aligning temporal and spatial scale of climate data from AgERA5 to agricultural yield data


11/03
- added file for downloading data from AgERA5


10/24
- added agricultural yield of sweet potato from 1961 - 2020 for top 10 producing countries
- sweet potato is underresearched in food security research under changing climates
- the top producing countries include countries in Africa which is not given much attention in agriculture but will be substantially by climate change
- next steps: collect information about climate data for selected countries and selected years and combine datasets


10/10

- looked at other research papers to finalize project idea 1

10/03

- received feedback from prof and ta
- looked at other research papers to finalize project ideas and data 


9/22

- updated abstract to include abstracts for both ideas
- note: data for idea 1 is available - need to be made usable; unsure about what data should be used for idea 2
- next steps: decide on which idea to persue - communicate with instructor for advice and suggestions if possible
