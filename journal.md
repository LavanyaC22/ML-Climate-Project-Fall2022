- updated list of countries with production regions and latitude and longitude information for getting data from AgERA5
- updated file for downloading data from AgERA5 to get data from all countries, years and variables
- files downloaded are in NC format - need to convert to tabular data that can be further processed 

11/23
- narrowed down production zone based on existing papers from 1980s-1990s


11/11
- met with Dafne to discuss issue with temporal and spatial scale of data
- next steps: narrow down production zone in each country in order to select climate data and aggregate climate data over region 
- once all data is processed, build regression based and/or tree based model


11/08
- further pre processing of agricultural yield data
- next steps: aligning temporal and spatial scale of climate data from AgERA5 to agricultural yield data


11/03
- added file for downloading data from AgERA5


10/24
- added agricultural yield of sweet potato from 1961 - 2020 for top 10 producing countries
- sweet potato is underresearched in food security research under changing climates
- the top producing countries include countries in Africa which is not given much attention in agriculture but will be substantially by climate change
- next steps: collect information about climate data for selected countries and selected years and combine datasets


10/10

- looked at other research papers to finalize project idea 1

10/03

- received feedback from prof and ta
- looked at other research papers to finalize project ideas and data 


9/22

- updated abstract to include abstracts for both ideas
- note: data for idea 1 is available - need to be made usable; unsure about what data should be used for idea 2
- next steps: decide on which idea to persue - communicate with instructor for advice and suggestions if possible
