The agricultural industry is greatly affected by climate change. As the climate changes, the quantity and nutritional quantity of crops wavers. This has a dire impact on global food production and food security. However, some communities are more at risk of these effects. Similarly, some crops are better suited for future climates. Both these communities and crops are underrepresented in research. This paper presents how Machine Learning can be used to predict yield and production of under researched crops grown as staple foods in developing countries such as Sweetpotato using open source and easily accessible agricultural and climate data. We found that a Random Forest model using agricultural data and annual climate aggregates perform the best at predicting yield while adding climate variables to agricultural data does not help predict production quantity. We also used our model to predict how the yield of the top Sweetpotato producers would change with temperature increases, assuming all other variables remain constant, and found that for most countries, the yield would increase.
